					<p style = "padding-top: 10px;"> Hi, my name is Jenny, current captain of the Anderson Science Olympiad team (if you've never heard of us, that's okay, we're still a bit new)! I'm a senior from Austin, TX, and I hope to major in biological sciences/public health and minor in comp sci. I'm kinda new-ish to comp sci; my first real exposure to compsci only happened in 9th grade with a dual enrollment comp sci class. I did FreeCodeCamp (and absolutely loved it) and a TON of tutorials in a bunch of languages (Python/HTML/CSS/Java/Javascript), but never had the motivation to do my own projects until <a href = "https://girlswhocode.com/"> Girls Who Code </a> happened and swept me off my feet. That camp was <i> amazing</i>. So I felt super inspired, and decided to create this hopefully useful website! </p>
